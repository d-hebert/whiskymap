Scotland is divided into five major regions for official Scotch Whisky categorization.
The Highlands, Lowlands, Islay, Campbeltown, and Speyside. The Highlands include a sixth, unofficial, subregion -- the Islands.
Being a well-regulated and almost exclusively barley-malt whisky, Scotch is considered idiosyncratic in general tasting profiles and yet each distillery produces a remarkably unique bottling.
This project reveals the subtle currents of terroir in Scotch whisky across the country. 
It also describes the unique tasting profile of each distillery individually.

### Functionality & MVP:

Users will

* View a 'heat map' for each major taste profile category accross a map of Scotland. Includes details on mouseover.
* Select a specific region to see a zoomed, more detailed map with similar functionaility. 
* Select a particular distillery to view an individual visualization of it's profile and read more about the distillery.
* Have a distillery recommended based upon a simple quiz.

The project will also include
* A production README

### Architecture and Technologies:

The project will use the following technologies:

* JavaScript
* D3.js
* HTML
* CSS

### Implementation Timeline:

#### Day 1:

* Focus the first half of the day on learning D3.
* Locate a source for map data at each level of views.
* Plan color scheme and styling.
* Build basic functioning map with each region zoomed upon click.

#### Day 2:

* Render basic representation of each distillery on the map.
* Build methods needed to retreive data in at each layer.
* Create tasting category selectors and rerender map appropriately.
* Using tasting data to update distillery appearance on map.
* Begin building view and graph representing individual distillery stats.

#### Day 3:

* Build a view for specific distillery selection with brief description.
* Iron any remaining UI/UX hangups.
* Polish.
* Add very secret easter egg.
